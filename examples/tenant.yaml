spec:
  # Namespace defaults to the name of the tenant. This is a no-op:
  namespace: acme-labs

  # External services can be bound to using the Open Service Broker API. The
  # Open Service Broker API defines an HTTP(S) interface between Platforms and Service
  # Brokers.
  #
  # In general, provisioning reserves a resource on a service; we call this reserved
  # resource a Service Instance. What a Service Instance represents can vary by
  # service. Examples include a single database on a multi-tenant server, a dedicated
  # cluster, or an account on a web application.
  #
  # Lessor allows you to define the Service Instance and will automatically create the
  # appropriate binding. The stateless applications should be aware of things like what
  # format secrets will be in when bound, etc. For this reason, during development,
  # consider creating the service instance first, observing the secrets that are put in
  # the namespace, and writing your Kubernetes configurations appropriately.

  # Deployable resources can be generated in a number of ways. As you're
  # growing, it can be easiest to write raw Kubernetes yaml. As your deployments
  # become more complex and related, it can be helpful to use a templating
  # abstraction like Helm, ksonnet, various templating engines, etc.
  apps:

    # Templates are similar to Helm packages in structure, but slightly simpler in
    # practice. Each item has two main components:
    # - template: a reference on how to get a template file (URL, file, secret, etc)
    # - values: values to interpolate into the template (in addition to defaults)
    templates:

      # If template type is "golang", the template is defined using the
      # {{ .GoTemplate }} convention: https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/
