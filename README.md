Lessor is a tool based on open standards for deploying, managing, and securing many instances of single-tenant applications on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Lessor allows you to proxy to and independently scale each tenant with network and data isolation by default. This approach makes application development simpler and more secure.

## Motivation

Companies that create products for other companies or teams often have to reason about how to deal with the tenancy of each team. There are generally two paths:

- Deploy one monolithic application that handles multi-tenant data isolation via application logic
- Deploy and proxy to many instances of smaller, more isolated single-tenant applications

When faced with these two options, most companies choose to build the multi-tenant monolith. While the second path results in simpler, more secure software, many single-tenant applications are much more difficult to operate and observe. Large multi-tenant monoliths, however, have a habit of becoming difficult to operate and observe as well though.

Lessor aims to make it easier to choose to deploy and proxy to many instances of a single-tenant application by providing tools, services, and libraries that are purpose-built for this kind of deployment strategy.

## How does it work?

Lessor uses the [Operator](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html) pattern to encode domain-specific operational knowledge into software. The Operator pattern describes using a Kubernetes [Custom Resorce Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/) and a [Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/controllers.md) to provide a declarative configuration interface to a self-healing system.

While most Kubernetes Operators deal with the administration of a single service, Lessor aims to automate larger application and cluster SRE objectives such as:

- tenant provisioning
- account management
- high-velocity deployments
- external resource acquisition
- secret distribution
- ingress proxy configuration

Each "tenant" in your environment is represented as a Kubernetes resource. Each Tenant resource contains the metadata that describes how to configure, deploy, and connect the microservices which make up the tenant. See one of the [example tenants](./examples/tenant.yaml) for an overview of the configurable attributes of a tenant.

## Downloads

### Binaries

To download the latest `lessor` binary, you can use `go get`:

```
go get -u github.com/lessor/lessor
```

## Getting Started

> *Note: Parts of this section are currently aspirational and may not work as described.*

### Installation Steps

To install Lessor in a Kubernetes cluster, you'll need:

- A Kubernetes cluster which supports Service objects of type LoadBalancer ([GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/), [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#quickstart), etc.)
- `kubectl` configured with admin access to your cluster

With your `kubectl` context configured to use your cluster, you can use the `lessor` CLI to "adopt" a cluster:

```
lessor adopt cluster
```

You can also create the required deployments via a hosted manifest:

```
curl -L https://lessor.io/install.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Verifying The Installation

First ensure the following Kubernetes services are deployed:

- lessor-ingress
- lessor-registrar

```
kubectl get services -n lessor-system
```

Next, ensure the corresponding Kubernetes pods are deployed and all containers are up and running:

- lessor-controller
- lessor-shuffler
- lessor-registrar

```
kubectl get pods -n lessor-system
```

### Deploy An Application

Try creating an example tenant:

```
kubectl apply -f ./examples/tenant.yaml
```

### Uninstalling

To delete all tenants and all Lessor deployment and services, you can run the following:

```
lessor eject cluster
```

## Development

### Cloning The Repo

Check out the repository to the appropriate location in your `$GOPATH`:

```
git clone git@github.com:lessor/lessor.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/lessor/lessor
```

### Installing Dependencies

Lessor uses [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) to manage Go dependencies:

```
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
dep ensure -vendor-only
```

### Running Tests

Use `go test` to run tests:

```
go test -cover -race -v ./...
```

### Builing The Code

Use `go build` to build the code:

```
go build
```

### Generating Clientset

To generate the [clientset](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/generating-clientset.md) for the Lessor API types, run the following:

```
./vendor/k8s.io/code-generator/generate-groups.sh all \
  github.com/lessor/lessor/pkg/client \
  github.com/lessor/lessor/pkg/apis \
  lessor.io:v1 \
  --go-header-file /dev/null
```

### Downloading Containers

Lessor containers are published on [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/). The Lessor containers are not public so you may need to run the following to configure local access:

```
gcloud config configurations activate <configuration>
gcloud docker --authorize-only
```

The `latest` tag is continuously built from the `master` via [Google Container Builder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/) and published on [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/):

```
docker pull gcr.io/lessor-io/lessor:latest
```

Each commit to each branch of the Lessor repository (`git@github.com:lessor/lessor.git`) also builds a container with the following naming scheme:`gcr.io/lessor-io/lessor:branch-commitsha`. For example:

```
docker pull gcr.io/lessor-io/lessor:master-81ea9bf9c8672a3c07be338dd6e2e8fd10d6cfba
```

Development branches (and their containers) are usually deleted as soon as possible, but the master containers should stay around for at least a few releases.
