## Introduction

Lessor is an open platform for deploying, managing, and securing many instances of tenanted applications on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Lessor allows you to independently operate and scale each tenant with network and data isolation by default. This approach makes application development simpler and more secure.

## Use Cases

### B2B SaaS

Companies that create products for other companies or teams often have to reason about how to deal with the tenancy of each team. There are generally two paths:

- Deploy one monolithic application that handles multi-tenant data isolation via application logic
- Deploy and proxy to many instances of smaller, more isolated single-tenant applications

When faced with these two options, most companies choose to build the multi-tenant monolith. While the second path results in simpler, more secure software, many single-tenant applications are much more difficult to operate and observe. Large multi-tenant monoliths, however, have a habit of becoming difficult to operate and observe as well though.

Lessor aims to make it easier to choose to deploy and proxy to many instances of a single-tenant application by providing tools, services, and libraries that are purpose-built for this kind of deployment strategy.

## How Does It Work?

Lessor uses the [Operator](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html) pattern to encode domain-specific operational knowledge into software. The Operator pattern describes using a Kubernetes [Custom Resorce Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/) and a [Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/controllers.md) to provide a declarative configuration interface to a self-healing system.

While most Kubernetes Operators deal with the administration of a single service, Lessor aims to automate larger application and cluster SRE objectives such as:

- provisioning
- high-velocity deployments
- external resource acquisition
- secret distribution

### `Tenant` Resource

Each complete application instance in your environment is represented as a Kubernetes resource called "Tenant". Each Tenant resource contains the metadata that describes how to configure, deploy, and connect the microservices which make up the instance. See an [example CRD](./examples/crd.yaml) for a more complete example of the configurable attributes of a tenant.

The following is a more minimal tenant that shows how to use the Open Service Broker API to bind to a MySQL server in Azure and deploy a set of minimally templated Kubernetes resources.

```yaml
apiVersion: lessor.io/v1
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: acme-labs
  labels:
    name: acme-labs

spec:
  # Namespace defaults to the name of the tenant. This is a no-op:
  namespace: acme-labs

  # External services can be bound to using the Open Service Broker API. The
  # Open Service Broker API defines an HTTP(S) interface between Platforms and Service
  # Brokers.
  #
  # Lessor allows you to define the Service Instance and will automatically create the
  # appropriate binding. The stateless applications should be aware of things like what
  # format secrets will be in when bound, etc. For this reason, during development,
  # consider creating the service instance first, observing the secrets that are put in
  # the namespace, and writing your Kubernetes configurations appropriately.
  serviceCatalog:
    instances:
      - clusterServiceClassExternalName: azure-mysql
        clusterServicePlanExternalName: basic50
        parameters:
          location: eastus
          resourceGroup: demo

  # Deployable resources can be generated in a number of ways. As you're
  # growing, it can be easiest to write raw Kubernetes yaml. As your deployments
  # become more complex and related, it can be helpful to use a templating
  # abstraction like Helm, ksonnet, various templating engines, etc.
  apps:

    # Templates are similar to Helm packages in structure, but slightly simpler in
    # practice. Each item has two main components:
    # - template: a reference on how to get a template file (URL, file, secret, etc)
    # - values: values to interpolate into the template (in addition to defaults)
    templates:

      # If template type is "golang", the template is defined using the
      # {{ .GoTemplate }} convention: https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/
      - name: kuard-golang
        type: golang
        url: https://lessor.io/latest/examples/templates/kuard-golang.yaml
        values:
          image: gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:1
```
