## Introduction

Lessor is an open platform for deploying, managing, and securing multi-tenant workloads on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

### `Tenant` Custom Resource

Each complete application instance in your environment is represented by the "Tenant" Kubernetes custom resource. See an [example CRD](./examples/crd.yaml) for a more complete example of the configurable attributes of a tenant.

The following is a minimal example:

```yaml
apiVersion: lessor.io/v1
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: acme-labs
  labels:
    name: acme-labs

spec:
  namespaces:
  - acme-labs
  - acme-labs-dev
  - acme-labs-skunkworks
```

### Controller

Lessor uses the [Operator](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html) pattern to encode domain-specific operational knowledge into software. The Operator pattern describes using a Kubernetes [Custom Resorce Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/) and a [Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/controllers.md) to provide a declarative configuration interface to a self-healing system.
